### Transformations

The script "run_analysis.R" has been submitted to CleanDataPeerAssignment repo. It performs all the transformations in this assignment. Here is a brief description of what it does:

* Downloads data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip using the default method, as method="curl" produces an error on Windows 8, and unzips it. 
* Loads data from the following files into R: features.txt, activity_labels.txt, x_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt
* Sets labels to identify measurements 
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, by using grep with regular expressions on column names. Only the columns that contained the words "mean" and "std" are selected. That produces a list of columns with "mean()", "std()" and "meanFreq()" in their names, which indicates that mean, standard deviation or weighted average of the frequency components have been calculated and stored in those variable. 
* Merges data sets containing activity identifiers and subject identifiers with the measurement dataset by performing cbind
* Merges training set and test set by performing rbind
* Adds descriptive activity names as a separate column, named "activityname". The activity names were taken from activity_labels.txt and all "_" were replaced with empty spaces for readability.
* Melts the dataset by activity and subject
* Takes the average of each variable, using dcast function on the melted set
* Writes the resulted data set into analysis_output.txt using write.table

### Explanation of Column Names

The first three columns in the resulted dataset are 
* subject - identifies the person who performed the activity
* activity - index of an activity performed
* activityname - descriptive activity name

The column names of the measurements were preserved according to the features_info.txt that came with the original dataset for easier traceability.

The following is the expert from features_info.txt that pertains to the column names of the resulted dataset:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

### Result

The resulted dataset contains averages of all calculated means and standard deviations found in the original data set per person and per activity. 

It is stored in a comma separated text file, named "analysis_output.txt"
