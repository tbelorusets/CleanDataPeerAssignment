### Introduction

For this assignment the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphons has been cleaned to only contain measurements on the mean and standard deviation, to contain descriptive activity names and to have descriptive labels for each measurement. Then the average of each variable for each activity and each subject has been calculated and a tidy dataset  has been produced. The resulted dataset was submitted on the assignment page and the script, run_analysis.R, with README.md and CodeBook.md have been submitted to CleanDataPeerAssignment repo.

### Contents of CleanDataPeerAssignment repo

* README.md - explains the contents of each file
* run_analysis.R - the script that performs transformations on the data and produces the tidy dataset
* CodeBook.md - explains the transformations that were performed by the script, the variable names that were produced and the resulting dataset
* analysis_output.txt - comma delimited file containing the produced tidy dataset
